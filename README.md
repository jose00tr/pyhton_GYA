## Problem Statement 
In the current digital era, investing in the trading market has gained popularity as an alternative and lucrative investment avenue. However, the financial market is highly volatile and complex, making investment decision-making a challenge for many investors. Obtaining accurate and timely information is crucial for making conscious and informed investment decisions.

In this context, there arises the need to develop a data management and storage system that enables investors to access, analyze, and utilize data obtained from sources in the market. Brokers in the market, such as Interactive Brokers, provide advanced trading platforms and APIs that allow for the extraction of up-to-date data.

## Files on directory:
* db: Contains the files (.csv) extracted from the Interactive Brokers platform for various financial instruments.
* DataFrames: Contains the dataframes (.csv) with the final data after management and transformation with Python.
* Extraccion_Data.py: Script for extracting financial data.
* Trabajo_FinalGYA.ipynb: Script for managing and storing data using Python libraries and tools.
* Planteamiento_del_problema.pdf: Explanatory document with information about the project.
* Crypto_PBI.pbix: PowerBI document for visualizing the SQL tables and results.
* Proyecto_final_G.mp4: An explanatory video from the group with all the project details.

## Conclusions
* Python stands out as a powerful tool that facilitates data extraction, transformation, and manipulation in a variety of contexts. In this project, it enabled the achievement of the general objective of developing a system/algorithm for managing and storing data in a financial market.
* Exploratory data analysis plays a fundamental role in providing information about the origin, format, variety, and characteristics of our data. It is from this analysis that raw data is transformed and adapted into the information that will be stored in the database. This information serves as a source of support for the reader in making informed decisions.
* By storing data in databases, the visualization process is simplified using tools like Power BI, allowing easy and accessible access for everyday people or those who are not as proficient in programming languages like Python.
* The system developed in this project has the potential to be replicated in other financial instruments and contexts, such as the gold market, corporate stocks, and currencies, demonstrating its versatility and applicability in different areas.
